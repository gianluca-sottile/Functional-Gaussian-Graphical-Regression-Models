## Required R packages:

CRAN packages:
- cglasso (you need to install by source the version 2.0.5 contained at the following link **[CGLASSO](https://github.com/gianluca-sottile/Hematopoiesis-network-inference-from-RT-qPCR-data/blob/main/02%20-%20Simulations/SimulationStudy2/CGLASSO/cglasso_2.0.5.tar.gz)**)
- fda
- grplasso
- JGL
- ggplot2

## Simulation Study 1
This folder contains two subfolders: 
1. containing the script to run the first simulation study **Effect of sample size on predictive and graph recovery power**. The main functions needed to implement the jcglasso estimator are contained at the following link **[JCGLASSO](https://github.com/gianluca-sottile/Hematopoiesis-network-inference-from-RT-qPCR-data/tree/main/01%20-%20RCode)**
2. all the figures of the manuscript of the first simulation scenario
